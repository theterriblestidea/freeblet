Description: Guo and Hall thinning algorithm
        ===============================
        
        This is a Python 3 module of Guo and Hall* thinning algorithm implemented in C.
        
        Thinning is the operation that takes a binary image and contracts the foreground until only single-pixel wide lines remain. It is also known as skeletonization. This package implements the thinning algorithm by Guo and Hall* for Numpy arrays. It is thus compatible with OpenCV. The algorithm is implemented in C and fairly fast.
